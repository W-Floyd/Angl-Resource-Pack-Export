##### Out of order

Exported zip files ready for Minecraft. *Almost never* the latest version, you can check https://github.com/W-Floyd/Angl-Resource-Pack for up to date source files.

As the pack has grown, the bandwidth required for me to keep this maintained has also grown, as has the disk space occupied (I don't want to be mean to GitHub). Unfortunately, the bandwidth required is beyond what I am currently able to support, so the plan for now is to leave this as is, and decommission it when I have a better solution available. Most likely will be tagged releases on the source repo, with pre-rendered, well optimized, well compressed zips attached, maybe using something automated like this https://github.com/codeclou/publish-github-release-assets-helper

**For those uninitiated in GitHub**
NOTE - Don't just right click and save as file! Either download a zip of the whole repo, or left click on the file, then click "Download" or "View Raw".
