Exported zip files ready for Minecraft. May not be the latest version, you can check https://github.com/W-Floyd/Angl-Resource-Pack for more up to date source files.

As time goes on, exporting multiple packs becomes a more and more laborious task. So I may not update the zip files for a few days at a time.

**For those uninitiated in GitHub**
NOTE - Don't just right click and save as file! Either download a zip of the whole repo, or left click on the file, then click "View Raw"
